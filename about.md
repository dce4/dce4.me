He likes to be called as "dce4". He likes to break things and learn how they work, that way he happen to meet with Cyber Security and Linux. After he realized that breaking things are easier than fixing them up again, he started taking notes to make it easier. He is willing to share his notes in this blog after he transforms those notes into a human readable form which he finds this part as the hardest part of the whole process.


He likes to share what he develops <a href="https://github.com/dce4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.
