Let us start with meaning of worshipping. Worshipping is simply defined by showing reverence and adore to a deity, but lets dive into it a little. How do we show our reverence and adore to the “supreme” one/ones? In [Abrahamic Religions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abrahamic_religions), there are some rites and ceremonies that intended to show the inability of people and how pathetic people-servants- are without Him to the Creator. When we think of why there are those rites, we realize that there must have been some people who did not think that way, which they think opposite of this way: They could exist without the Creator, because they were already <i>Creators</i>.

What can the Creator do, we -all the people in the world- can’t? Create lives? Rule the whole population? Understand the unknown? Manage the disasters? See everything? Seriously, which one of those actions we are not striving to be able to do them collectively? Are we trying to be the Creators, by trying to improve our probability of staying alive? Are we inventing new technologies that improves our life quality for making ourselves actual <b>Gods</b>?

> <i>Everybody worships. The only choice is what we worship. Some people kneel to money, some to power or intellect.</i>

Actually, this episode of Messiah got me thinking about all of those ideas. We are trying to stay alive in this society by going school, college; having a job, a responsibility to get paid. We are only getting paid while we are serving the society and almost all of us follow this rule as a default, without questioning it. Therefore, maybe we are unintentionally idolizing our jobs, companies, skills to worship to the humanity, to *ourselves*. But when we think of it, how can we survive if we don't serve to the humanity?

If you have a answer or want to criticize those ideas, feel free to share!
